     <h2>Prayer To Masks- Leopold Sedar Senghor</h2>
     <p>
     <em><strong>
        Masks! Oh Masks!<br>
        Black mask, red mask, you black and white masks,<br>
        Rectangular masks through whom the spirit breathes,<br>
        I greet you in silence!<br>
        And you too, my panterheaded ancestor.<br>
        You guard this place, that is closed to any feminine laughter, to any mortal smile.<br>
        You purify the air of eternity, here where I breathe the air of my fathers.<br>
        Masks of maskless faces, free from dimples and wrinkles.<br>
        You have composed this image, this my face that bends over the altar of white paper.<br>
        In the name of your image, listen to me!<br>
        Now while the Africa of despotism is dying – it is the agony of a pitiable princess,<br>
        Just like Europe to whom she is connected through the naval.<br>
        Now turn your immobile eyes towards your children who have been called<br>
        And who sacrifice their lives like the poor man his last garment<br>
        So that hereafter we may cry ‘here’ at the rebirth of the world being the leaven that the white flour needs.<br>
        For who else would teach rhythm to the world that has died of machines and cannons?<br>
        For who else should ejaculate the cry of joy, that arouses the dead and the wise in a new dawn?<br>
        Say, who else could return the memory of life to men with a torn hope?<br>
        They call us cotton heads, and coffee men, and oily men.<br>
        They call us men of death.<br>
        But we are the men of the dance whose feet only gain<br>
        power when they beat the hard soil.

     <h2>Solitude- Ella Wheeler Wilcox</h2>
     <p>
     <em><strong>
        Laugh, and the world laughs with you;<br>
        Weep, and you weep alone;<br>
        For the sad old earth must borrow its mirth,<br>
        But has trouble enough of its own.<br>
        Sing, and the hills will answer;<br>
        Sigh, it is lost on the air;<br>
        The echoes bound to a joyful sound,<br>
        But shrink from voicing care.<br>
     <br>
        Rejoice, and men will seek you;<br>
        Grieve, and they turn and go;<br>
        They want full measure of all your pleasure,<br>
        But they do not need your woe.<br>
        Be glad, and your friends are many;<br>
        Be sad, and you lose them all,—<br>
        There are none to decline your nectared wine,<br>
        But alone you must drink life’s gall.<br>
     <br>
        Feast, and your halls are crowded;<br>
        Fast, and the world goes by.<br>
         Succeed and give, and it helps you live,<br>
         But no man can help you die.<br>
         There is room in the halls of pleasure<br>
         For a large and lordly train,<br>
         But one by one we must all file on<br>
         Through the narrow aisles of pain.<br>

     <h2>Poem of Return- Jofre Rocha</h2>
     <p>
     <em><strong>
        When I return from the land of exile and silence<br>
        do not bring me flowers.<br>
     <br>
        Bring me rather all the dews,<br>
        tears of dawns which witnessed dramas.<br>
        Bring me the immense hunger for love<br>
        and the plaint of tumid sexes in star-studded night.<br>
        Bring me the long night of sleeplessness<br>
        with mothers mourning, their arms bereft of sons.<br>
        When I return from the land of exile and silence,<br>
        no, do not bring me flowers ...<br>
     <br>
        Bring me only, just this<br>
        the last wish of heroes fallen at day-break<br>
        with a wingless stone in hand<br>
        and a thread of anger snaking from their eyes.<br>

     <h2>Sonnet 130- William Shakespear</h2>
     <p>
     <em><strong>
        My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;<br>
        Coral is far more red than her lips' red;<br>
        If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;<br>
        If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.<br>
        I have seen roses damasked, red and white,<br>
        But no such roses see I in her cheeks;<br>
        And in some perfumes is there more delight<br>
        Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.<br>
        I love to hear her speak, yet well I know<br>
        That music hath a far more pleasing sound;<br>
        I grant I never saw a goddess go;<br>
        My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground.<br>
        And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare<br>
        As any she belied with false compare.<br>

     <h2>At a funeral- Dennis Brutus</h2>
     <p>
     <em><strong>
        Black, green and gold at sunset: pageantry<br> 
        And stubbled graves: expectant, of eternity, <br>
        In bride’s-white, nun’s-white veils the nurses gush their bounty <br>
        Of red-wine cloaks, frothing the bugled dirging slopes <br>
        Salute! Then ponder all this hollow panoply   <br>
        For one whose gifts the mud devours, with our hopes. <br>
        Oh all you frustrate ones, powers tombed in dirt, <br>
        Aborted, not by Death but carrion books of birth <br>
        Arise!  The brassy shout of Freedom stirs our earth;<br> 
        Not death but death’s-head tyranny scythes our ground <br>    
        And plots our narrow cells of pain defeat and dearth:<br>
        Better that we should die, than that we should lie down<br>
     <br>

     <h2> It is a beauteous evening, calm and free- William Wordsworth</h2>
     <p>
     <em><strong>
        It is a beauteous evening, calm and free,<br>
        The holy time is quiet as a Nun<br>
        Breathless with adoration; the broad sun<br>
        Is sinking down in its tranquility;<br>
        The gentleness of heaven broods o'er the Sea;<br>
        Listen! the mighty Being is awake,<br>
        And doth with his eternal motion make<br>
        A sound like thunder—everlastingly.<br>
        Dear child! dear Girl! that walkest with me here,<br>
        If thou appear untouched by solemn thought,<br>
        Thy nature is not therefore less divine:<br>
        Thou liest in Abraham's bosom all the year;<br>
        And worshipp'st at the Temple's inner shrine,<br>
        God being with thee when we know it not.<br>

    <h2>I wandered lonely as a cloud- William Wordsworth</h2>
    <p>
    <em><strong>
       I wandered lonely as a cloud<br>
       That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br>
       When all at once I saw a crowd,<br>
       A host, of golden daffodils;<br>
       Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br>
       Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br>
    <br>
       Continuous as the stars that shine<br>
       And twinkle on the milky way,<br>
       They stretched in never-ending line<br>
       Along the margin of a bay:<br>
       Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br>
       Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br>
    <br>
       The waves beside them danced; but they<br>
       Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br>
       A poet could not but be gay,<br>
       In such a jocund company:<br>
       I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br>
       What wealth the show to me had brought:<br>
    <br>
       Far often, when on my couch I lie<br>
       In vacant or in pensive mood,<br>
       They flash upon that inward eye<br>
       Which is the bliss of solitude;<br>
       And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br>
       And dances with the daffodils.<br>
